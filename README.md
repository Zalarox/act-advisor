# ACT Advisor

An app to self-track your ACT skills.

## What is ACT?

ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) is a modern therapy modality. You can read more about it [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapy-types/).

## What is the ACT Advisor?

It is a self-reported measure of psychological flexibility rated over 6 different categories. A sample can be seen [here](https://www.helpwithact.com/advisor/) and a downloadable PDF with more details is located [here](https://stevenchayes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-ACT-Advisor.pdf). I found myself wanting to track the ratings over time, including averaging them to see how my scores are doing. That is the purpose of this React app.

## Running the app

1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/Zalarox/act-advisor.git`
2. Install dependencies `pnpm install`
3. Run the 'dev' script `pnpm run dev`
